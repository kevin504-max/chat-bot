# FlashBot FullStack API ü§ñ

The FlashBot Fullstack API is a comprehensive project involving the creation of a chatbot within the Telegram messaging application. 
This chatbot was meticulously developed to serve as a user assistance tool, streamlining tasks through straightforward commands. 
With its efficient and user-friendly approach, the FlashBot provides valuable information and offers a practical way to interact.

Furthermore, it's important to note that the bot is fully integrated with Telegram and has an external interface 
accessible by clicking on [here](https://chat-bot-wheat-two.vercel.app/chat). However, it is imperative that the bot is started within the Telegram application beforehand.
