# FlashBot FullStack API ü§ñ

The FlashBot Fullstack API is a comprehensive project involving the creation of a chatbot within the Telegram messaging application. 
This chatbot was meticulously developed to serve as an user assistance tool, streamlining tasks through straightforward commands. 
With its efficient and user-friendly approach, the FlashBot provides valuable information and offers a practical way to interact.

Furthermore, it's important to note that the bot is fully integrated with Telegram and has an external interface 
accessible by clicking on [here](https://chat-bot-wheat-two.vercel.app/chat). However, it is imperative that the bot is started within the Telegram application beforehand.

## üõ† Technologies Used

* A code editor such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## üè° Getting Started Locally

1. Clone this repository and enter "locally-test" branch
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/kevin504-max/chat-bot.git
  git checkout locally-test
```

2. Configure your database on [MongoDB Atlas](https://account.mongodb.com/), login with your account and get your database credentials.
After create your database, click in "Connect", then option "Compass", you gonna see the link to connect with your database.

## üß¨ Project Structure
This project FlashBot Fullstack API is organized in two distincts masses: `frontend` and `backend`.
Each of these play a key role in the overall functionality and architecture of the application.

### üîô Backend
The backend is responsible for the configuration and central logic of the project that keep the Telegram bot running. Furthermore, the backend is responsible for the database connection and the API endpoints that are used by the frontend.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Frontend
The frontend handles the user interface and the user experience of the application. It is responsible for the visual elements and the overall design of the application. The frontend is also responsible for the user authentication and the API calls to the backend.

## üß™ Automated Tests
The systems is able to make automated tests, in locally and and main branch. In locally, you have to start the application with `npm run start` first.
Then you are able to execute the following command, and follow the process (if you are in the main branch, just execute the command)
```bash
  npm test
```

## üöÄ Getting Started >>Online<<
The application is acessible online by clicking [here](https://chat-bot-wheat-two.vercel.app/chat). 
But how i make the deploy of my code, the bot that is running is the bot that i use to test the application,
but don't worry, you still can interact with the bot! All you need to do is start the bot in the Telegram chat, you go to there clicking [here](https://t.me/FullstackAPIBot).
